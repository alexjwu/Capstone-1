Wine Procurement 

1. What is the problem you want to solve?

I want to open a wine boutique. I want to sell highly rated wine while maintaing a good cost to rating ratio. I want to see if that are correlation between ratings and :varietal, region, winery, and price to help predict which type of wines would give the greatest return.

2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

Based on the assumption that rating is a predictor of demand. The findings of the analysis will determine which wines the client(me) will buy. I will procure the highest demand wines and wines with the greatest return on investment.

3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data
